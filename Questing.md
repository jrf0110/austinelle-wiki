Questing is the key component to Austinelle. Quests are tasks that you want to get done. For me, that's tackling issues on Github or working out. It's important that you really get into character when creating your quests. The most important part is creating a compelling title for your quest. Think World of Warcraft style. Notice the card title isn't just "Fix the Forgot Password Feature." You put a story behind it that vaguely has a connection to the original task.

## Creating a Quest

There are six things to consider when making a quest:

* Title       - Should pertain to the description
* Description - Make up a situation in Austinelle relating to your character
* Objective   - This the actual task you need to perform (should be plain what you need to do IRL)
* Objectives  - This should a list of real world sub-tasks you need to perform to complete your quest
* Rewards     - Rewards usually XP and Gold
* Difficulty  - Label your quests with Green, Yellow, Orange, or Red to denote difficulty

## Completing a quest

Once all of your objectives are checked, you can now move your quest card from Accepted Quests to Completed Quests. Update your character cards to reflect the rewards acquired.
